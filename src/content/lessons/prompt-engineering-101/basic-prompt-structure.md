## The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

Every effective prompt has key components that help the AI understand exactly what you need. Let's break them down.

## The Four Elements

### 1. Role/Persona

Tell the AI who it should be:

```
You are an experienced marketing copywriter who specializes in tech startups.
```

### 2. Task

Clearly state what you want:

```
Write a product description for our new AI-powered calendar app.
```

### 3. Context

Provide relevant background:

```
The app is called "Calmly" and helps busy professionals reduce scheduling stress. Our target audience is remote workers aged 25-45.
```

### 4. Format

Specify how you want the output:

```
The description should be:
- 150-200 words
- Include 3 bullet points highlighting key features
- End with a compelling call to action
```

## Putting It All Together

Here's a complete prompt using all four elements:

```
You are an experienced marketing copywriter who specializes in tech startups.

Write a product description for our new AI-powered calendar app called "Calmly" that helps busy professionals reduce scheduling stress. Our target audience is remote workers aged 25-45.

The description should be:
- 150-200 words
- Include 3 bullet points highlighting key features
- End with a compelling call to action
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being too vague** - "Make it good" doesn't help
2. **Overloading with info** - Stick to relevant details
3. **Forgetting the format** - Always specify structure
4. **Not iterating** - First attempts often need refinement

## Practice Exercise

Try crafting a prompt for this scenario:

> You need an email subject line for a newsletter about AI productivity tools.

Think about: Who should the AI be? What exactly do you need? What context is relevant? What format works best?

## Key Takeaways

- Great prompts have four elements: Role, Task, Context, Format
- Each element serves a specific purpose
- The more specific you are, the better results you'll get
- Practice with different combinations to find what works
