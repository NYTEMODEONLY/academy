## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to get the best possible outputs from AI language models like ChatGPT and Claude.

## Why It Matters

When you interact with AI models, the quality of your output depends heavily on how you frame your request. A well-crafted prompt can be the difference between:

- A generic, unhelpful response
- A precise, actionable answer that solves your problem

## The Basics

At its core, a prompt is simply the text you send to an AI model. But there's an art to crafting prompts that work:

1. **Be specific** - Vague prompts get vague answers
2. **Provide context** - Help the AI understand your situation
3. **Set the format** - Tell the AI how you want the response structured
4. **Iterate** - Refine your prompts based on results

## Example

Here's the difference between a basic and optimized prompt:

**Basic prompt:**
```
Write about dogs.
```

**Optimized prompt:**
```
Write a 200-word blog post about the top 3 benefits of adopting a rescue dog. Use a friendly, conversational tone. Include a compelling opening hook and end with a call to action.
```

## Key Takeaways

- Prompts are instructions for AI models
- Better prompts = better outputs
- It's both an art and a science
- Practice and iteration are key to improvement

In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into the structure of effective prompts.
